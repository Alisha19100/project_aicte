Cyber security project
Project name:Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography
Overview
This project offers a neat way to hide a secret message inside an image. By first encrypting the message and then embedding it into an image, it ensures that your data stays safe and hidden.
What It Does:
Encrypts Your Message: The secret text is encrypted so that even if someone finds it, they canâ€™t read it without the key.
Hides the Encrypted Message: The encrypted message is seamlessly embedded into an image, keeping the image looking completely normal.
Retrieves and Decrypts: With the correct decryption key, the hidden message can be extracted and read.
